# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
 Here I have an Anonymized credit card transactions raw dataset. First I imported all the imporatant libraries and then uploaded the data set . at first I analysed data nature
 and meaning of every variable. here time of transaction is in sec format so i converted it into date time format , In data set Class represent type of transaction, it is genuine 
 transaction or fraud transaction. here class--> 0  represent Genuine transaction and Class--> 1 represent Fraud transaction. atfirst Exploratory Data Analysis is done and through
 analysis , I analysed that data set is highly Unbalanced . Hence model will give wrong prediction if the data will be unbalaced so first I balanced the data and then did the Model
 Preparation . I have analysed this Data by Random Forest Model and then Gradient boosting Model to detect fraud transaction .
